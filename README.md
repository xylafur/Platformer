# Platformer
##Simple platform game in JavaScript
Do you like playing as a little square dude and jumping around onto small red platforms with the hopes of reaching an equally smale purple box that will display win text???
If you do, then this game is for you!

I did all of the physics myself in order to try and comprehend some of the things that engines (like unity which i love <3 ) are doing behind the scenes.
It was a nice learning experience, but in the future I think that I'll just use a framework.
